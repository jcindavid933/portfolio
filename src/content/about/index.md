title: 'About Me'
---

What's up! I'm a collaborative and highly motivated software engineer with a get-stuff-done attitude, efficient time management skills, and a strong user focus. I have invested 1000+ hours in coding while doing my bootcamp. This has enabled me to build exceptional full stack web applications using multiple frameworks that provide intuitive user interfaces, while also having efficient back-end code.

I graduated from Pennsylvania State University (University Park) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering. For the past year, I have been honing my skills in full stack web development. With the help of the Coding Dojo bootcamp, I have been able to learn a lot of new technologies, and develop efficient and bug-free code. I am eager to learn new technologies that keep evolving in this awesome field of software engineering.
